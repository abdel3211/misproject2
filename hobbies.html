                        <h3>Soccer</h3>
                        <p>I grew up playing soccer and still play regularly with a local pickup group. It's a sport that keeps me active, builds endurance, and teaches practical teamwork.</p>
                        <p>Personal story: I remember a semester when I joined an intramural team with mostly strangers — over a few weeks we became a well-coordinated squad and made the playoffs. That experience taught me how quickly trust and communication can form when people focus on a shared goal.</p>
                        <p>Why it matters: Soccer keeps me fit and grounded. The sport sharpens leadership and communication skills I bring to group projects and work environments.</p>

                        <h3>Video Games</h3>
                        <p>Video games are a creative outlet where I enjoy strategy, storytelling, and cooperative play. I particularly like games that require planning and teamwork.</p>
                        <p>Personal story: I once collaborated with friends to design a multi-stage plan for an in-game event; coordinating roles and contingencies was surprisingly similar to project planning in real life.</p>
                        <p>Why it matters: Games keep my problem-solving skills sharp and provide opportunities to practice teamwork and decision-making under pressure.</p>
