Media placement instructions

Place your optimized media files in the following locations (paths used by `index.html`):

- files/headshot.jpg — Professional headshot (recommended 400x400 px, JPEG, quality 80)
- files/hobby1.jpg — Hobby 1 image (recommended 1200x800 px, JPEG/WebP)
- files/hobby2.jpg — Hobby 2 image (recommended 1200x800 px, JPEG/WebP)
- files/video-poster.jpg — Optional poster image for the video (1200x675)
- videos/welcome.mp4 — Short welcome video (MP4 H.264, under 30MB recommended)
- videos/welcome.webm — Optional WebM fallback for modern browsers

Optimization tips:
- Use a tool like ImageOptim (macOS) or Squoosh to reduce file size.
- Prefer WebP for web delivery when supported; include JPEG fallback for compatibility.
- For video, encode at 720p with a reasonable bitrate (2-4 Mbps) to keep sizes small.

Accessibility:
- Provide descriptive alt text for all images.
- Ensure the video has captions if possible.

If you'd like, I can generate small placeholder images and a demo video file you can replace later. To proceed with placeholders, tell me the preferred style (photographic, illustrated, or simple colored placeholders).
